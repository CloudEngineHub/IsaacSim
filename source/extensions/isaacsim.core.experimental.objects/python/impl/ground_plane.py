class GroundPlane(XformPrim):
    """High level class for creating/wrapping ground plane prims.

    Ground plane prims have the following USD structure:

    .. code-block:: cpp

        Xform        // GroundPlane instance
          |-- Plane  // for collision and physics
          |-- Mesh   // for rendering, since Plane is unsupported by Hydra rendering

    .. note::

        This class creates or wraps (one of both) ground plane prims according to the following rules:

        * If the prim paths exist, a wrapper is placed over the ground plane prims.
        * If the prim paths do not exist, ground plane prims are created at each path and a wrapper is placed over them.

    Args:
        paths: Single path or list of paths to existing or non-existing (one of both) ground plane prims.
            Can include regular expressions for matching multiple prims.
        sizes: Sizes of the ground planes (shape ``(N, 1)``).
            If the input shape is smaller than expected, data will be broadcasted (following NumPy broadcast rules).
            It has effect only when new ground plane prims are created. Ignored when wrapping existing prims.
        colors: Colors of the ground planes (shape ``(N, 3)``).
            If the input shape is smaller than expected, data will be broadcasted (following NumPy broadcast rules).
            It has effect only when new ground plane prims are created. Ignored when wrapping existing prims.
        positions: Positions in the world frame (shape ``(N, 3)``).
            If the input shape is smaller than expected, data will be broadcasted (following NumPy broadcast rules).
        translations: Translations in the local frame (shape ``(N, 3)``).
            If the input shape is smaller than expected, data will be broadcasted (following NumPy broadcast rules).
        orientations: Orientations in the world frame (shape ``(N, 4)``, quaternion ``wxyz``).
            If the input shape is smaller than expected, data will be broadcasted (following NumPy broadcast rules).
        scales: Scales to be applied to the prims (shape ``(N, 3)``).
            If the input shape is smaller than expected, data will be broadcasted (following NumPy broadcast rules).
        reset_xform_op_properties: Whether to reset the transformation operation attributes of the prims to a standard set.
            See :py:meth:`reset_xform_op_properties` for more details.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If resulting paths are mixed (existing and non-existing prims) or invalid.
        AssertionError: If wrapped prims are not ground planes.
        AssertionError: If both positions and translations are specified.
