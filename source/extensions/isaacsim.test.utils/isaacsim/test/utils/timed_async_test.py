    """Base test class that automatically times all test methods.

    This class extends omni.kit.test.AsyncTestCase to automatically measure and print
    the execution time of each test method. The timing information is displayed after
    each test completes, helping with performance monitoring and optimization.

    All test classes should inherit from this class instead of omni.kit.test.AsyncTestCase
    directly to benefit from automatic test timing functionality.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import asyncio
        >>> from isaacsim.test.utils.timed_async_test import TimedAsyncTestCase
        >>>
        >>> class MyTestCase(TimedAsyncTestCase):
        ...     async def test_example(self):
        ...         await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
        ...         self.assertTrue(True)
        >>>
        >>> # When running the test, output will include:
        >>> # [TEST TIMING] test_example: 0.100 seconds

        then records the current timestamp in _test_start_time, which will be used
        later in tearDown to calculate the test execution duration.

        This order ensures we measure only the test method execution time, excluding
        any framework setup overhead.

        (recorded in setUp) from the current time, then prints the timing information
        in a standardized format.

        The timing output includes the test method name and execution duration in seconds
        with three decimal places of precision. If setUp failed before recording the start
        time, timing information is skipped to avoid errors.
